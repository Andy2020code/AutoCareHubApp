Pay particular attention to hose connections and clamps. </p>   <p><strong>Step 3</strong> Pressure Inspection:</p> <p>WARNING : Turn off the car if on and wait at least a full 2 hours before proceeding with this step. </p> <p><strong>*Optional*</strong><br>Use a radiator pressure cap, replace the radiator cap with the pressure measurement tool and pump the tester to the recommended value and look for any drops in the pressure value. </p> <p>Another way to do it if do not own a tool similar to the one mentioned above, is to confirm that the car components temperature is low, then with your hands squeeze every radiator tube connection and listen for any suspicious hissing sounds, which can indicate a leak. </p>  "

If the automatic transmission fluid level falls below the <strong>warm</strong> line, you'll need to top up with automatic transmission fluid. </p> <strong>Grinding Noises:</strong><br> <strong> Jack up the vehicle and safely support it with jack stands. </strong> <p> Grab the wheel and tire assembly at the top and bottom (6 oclock and 12 oclock positions) and shake it back and forth paying attention to noises. If the wheel moves as you shake it, then it means that the hub is bad, and it needs replacement. </p> <p><strong>Visual Inspection:</strong><br> Make sure the vehicle has enough support and remove the wheel assembly. Look for signs of wear and check for friction material coming off of it. </p> <p> Remove the caliper or drum to inspect the brake pads. We're looking for brakes that are worn down to the backing plate or wear indicator. </p> <p><strong>Replace worn clutch disc and pressure plate:</strong> These components are responsible for smoothly engaging gears and wear and tear can cause grinding. <strong> (manual transmission only) </strong></p> <p><strong>Synchronizer ring replacement:</strong> Synchronizers help gears mesh smoothly and worn synchronizers can cause grinding.

This process happens in a series of precise steps, known as the four stroke cycle: </p> <strong> Intake Stroke: </strong> <p> The piston moves downwards in the cylinder, creating a vacuum chamber, then an intake valve opens, creating a mixture of air and fuel <strong>(gasoline vapor in modern engines)</strong>, by pulling it into the cylinder with the vacuum. The exhaust valve remains closed during this process.</p> <strong> Compression Stroke: </strong> <p> With both intake and exhaust valves closed, the piston moves upwards in the cylinder, compressing the air and fuel mixture. This compression increases the temperature and pressure of the mixture by a lot, making it more readily ignitable. </p> <strong> Combustion Stroke: </strong> <p> The spark plug in gasoline engines or high pressure and heat in diesel engines, ignites the compressed air and fuel mixture, the explosive burn significantly increases in pressure and temperature within the cylinder. This force pushes the piston downwards with huge power, generating mechanical work. </p> <strong> Exhaust Stroke: </strong> <p> The exhaust valve opens as the piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder. The piston moves upwards again as a result of the mechanical work, forcing the burned gases out of the cylinder through the open exhaust valve, but the intake valve remains closed during this process </p> <p> This four stroke cycle repeats continuously as long as the engine is running. The rotation of the crankshaft converts the reciprocating (up-and-down) motion of the piston into rotational motion that is eventually transmitted to the car's wheels. </p> "

Worn brushes, faulty solenoid, damaged wiring, or beyond the components sometimes the starter motor itself malfunctions.</p> <p><strong>Fuel Pump:</strong><br> Engine starts but dies shortly after, which could be because of a fuel pump that might not generate enough pressure to the fuel injection system.</p> <p><strong>Ignition System:</strong><br> Engine cranks but doesn't start, usually because of a faulty spark plug, ignition coil, or could be the crankshaft position sensor that is not working properly<p> <p><strong>Security System</strong><br> Engine cranks but doesn't start, and there are no unusual noises present, in some cases, the car security systems can immobilize the vehicle if they malfunction or detect suspicious activity attempts.</p> <strong>Leaking Engine Coolant:</strong><p>Leaks can originate from various components such as:</p><p><strong>Radiator hoses:</strong> <br>Cracks or loose connections in the hoses can cause leaks.</p> <p><strong>Water pump:</strong><br> A failing water pump can leak coolant internally or externally.</p> <p><strong>Thermostat housing:</strong><br> A faulty housing gasket can leak coolant.</p> <p><strong>Radiator:</strong> <br>In rare cases, the radiator itself might develop a crack and leak.</p> <strong>Excessive Oil Consumption:</strong> <p>Burning oil smell or blue smoke coming out of the exhaust might be due to:</p> <p><strong>Worn Piston Rings:</strong><br> With a worn piston ring, is easier for oil to fall deep into the combustion chamber.</p> <p><strong>Valve Seal:</strong> Worn valve seals can allow oil to leak into the cylinder head and get burned. </p> <p><strong>Positive Crankcase Ventilation:</strong> A faulty PCV valve can lead to oil burning, leaks, and excessive oil pressure. </p> <strong>Check Engine Light:</strong>  <p>The check engine light comes up on the dashboard. Although this doesn't always indicate a major issue, it does deserve attention. </p> <p><strong>Emission System:</strong><br>Faulty sensors or components can trigger the light</p> <p><strong>Loose Gas Cap:</strong> <br>This also triggers the check engine light meaning potential fuel system issues as well as by something minor.<p> <strong>Overheating:</strong> <p>Dashboard shows engine running hotter than usual.</p> <p><strong>Low Coolant:</strong><br>Possible issues may maybe due to coolant boiling, causing lack of circulation in the engine, and so emptying your tank.</p> <p><strong>Faulty Thermostat:</strong><br>A stuck closed thermostat can prevent coolant from circulating properly. </p> <p><strong>Cooling Fan:</strong><br>It is possible that the fan is not drawing enough air or none at all through the radiator.</p> <strong>Remember:</strong> <p> This list provides general information, and the specific cause of your car not starting could be different.

                "<p><strong>Car batteries</strong> typically last a few years, and if yours has been acting up lately, it might be time for a replacement. Before shelling out for a new one, it's wise to check for common issues and their fixes. Here's a rundown of the 12 most frequent problems to look for:</p> <p><strong>Dead Battery:</strong><br> This is often the main issue. Your battery may be drained due to long periods of inactivity, a faulty alternator, old age, or corrosion on the terminals. Try charging it or jump-starting the vehicle.</p> <p><strong>Forgotten Headlights:</strong><br> Leaving your headlights on without the engine running can drain the battery. Turn them off as soon as you notice and consider jump-starting if needed.</p> <p><strong>Loose Battery Terminals:</strong><br> Check for loose connections or corrosion on the terminals. Clean them and tighten them if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Old Battery:</strong> <br> Car batteries typically last 3-5 years. If yours is showing signs of deterioration, it might be time to replace it.</p> <p><strong>Charging Problem:</strong> <br> If your alternator fails, your battery won't charge properly. Test the alternator's voltage output to determine if it needs replacing.</p> <p><strong>Corroded Terminals:</strong> <br> Corrosion on terminals can disrupt the electrical connection. Clean them and consider using anti-corrosion felt washers.</p> <p><strong>Extreme Temperatures:</strong> <br> Cold weather can drain batteries faster, while high heat can reduce performance. Park your vehicle in sheltered areas when possible.</p> <p><strong>Swollen Battery Case:</strong> <br> A swollen or bulging battery case indicates internal damage and should be replaced.</p> <p><strong>Leaking Fluid:</strong> <br> Fluid leaks can indicate overcharging or damage. Neutralize the acid, clean the area, and address the cause of the leak.</p> <p><strong>Damaged Cells:</strong> <br> If one or more cells are damaged, the battery won't hold a full charge and needs replacing.</p> <p><strong>Poor Driving Habits:</strong> <br> Frequent short trips without allowing the battery to recharge fully, or excessive accessory use, can drain the battery. Adjust your driving habits accordingly.</p> <p>By identifying and addressing these common issues, you can extend the life of your car battery and avoid unexpected breakdowns.</p> "
