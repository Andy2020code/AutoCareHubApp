    "radiator": "A radiator is a car part that helps cool down the engine by releasing heat into the air. It works by circulating coolant through the engine and then cooling it down using airflow." ,
    "battery": "A car battery is a rechargeable device that provides electrical energy to start the engine and power various electrical components in a vehicle. It stores energy in a chemical form and releases it as electrical energy when needed. The battery also stabilizes the voltage to keep the electrical system running smoothly when the engine is off.",
    "alternator": "The car alternator converts mechanical energy from the engine into electrical energy to charge the battery and power electrical systems while the engine is running. It plays a vital role in maintaining the battery's charge and ensuring the proper functioning of electrical components like lights and entertainment systems. If the alternator malfunctions, it can lead to a drained battery and electrical system failure, potentially leaving the vehicle inoperable. Thus, maintaining a healthy alternator is crucial for the vehicle's performance and reliability.",
    "starter motor": "A car starter motor is an electric motor responsible for starting the internal combustion engine of a vehicle. It works by turning the engine's crankshaft, which initiates the engine's operation. When you turn the ignition key, the starter motor engages with the engine's flywheel or flexplate and rotates it to begin the engine's combustion cycle. Once the engine starts running independently, the starter motor disengages automatically.",
    "brakes": "A car brake is a mechanical component responsible for slowing down or stopping the vehicle's motion. It typically includes several parts such as brake pads, brake rotors (or discs), brake calipers, brake lines, and brake fluid. When you press the brake pedal in a car, hydraulic pressure is applied to the brake pads, causing them to clamp onto the brake rotors, which generates friction and slows down the vehicle. This process converts kinetic energy into heat energy, helping to bring the car to a stop.",
    "water_pump":"A car water pump is a crucial component of the engine cooling system. Its primary function is to circulate coolant (antifreeze) through the engine block, cylinder head, radiator, and other components to regulate the engine temperature. The water pump is typically belt-driven and uses impeller blades to push coolant through the system. This continuous circulation helps dissipate excess heat generated by the engine during operation, preventing it from overheating.",
    "fuel_pump": "A car fuel pump is a component responsible for delivering fuel from the fuel tank to the engine. It maintains a consistent flow of fuel to the engine at the appropriate pressure to ensure proper combustion. In vehicles with internal combustion engines, fuel pumps can be mechanical or electric, and they play a crucial role in the efficient operation of the vehicle.",
    "spark_plugs":"Car spark plugs are small, yet critical components in the ignition system of a vehicle. They are typically installed in the cylinder head(s) of an internal combustion engine. Spark plugs serve the primary purpose of igniting the air-fuel mixture within the engine cylinders by generating an electric spark. This ignition process initiates combustion, which powers the engine and allows the vehicle to operate. Spark plugs are essential for the efficient performance of an engine, as they ensure proper combustion and fuel efficiency.",
    "ignition_coil":"A car ignition coil is a component of the ignition system responsible for converting the low voltage from the battery into the high voltage needed to ignite the fuel-air mixture in the engine's cylinders. It typically consists of two coils of wire wrapped around an iron core. When electrical current flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field. When the current is interrupted, the magnetic field collapses, inducing a high voltage in the secondary coil, which is then sent to the spark plugs to ignite the fuel mixture.",
