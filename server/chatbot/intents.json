Pay particular attention to hose connections and clamps. </p>   <p><strong>Step 3</strong> Pressure Inspection:</p> <p>WARNING : Turn off the car if on and wait at least a full 2 hours before proceeding with this step. </p> <p><strong>*Optional*</strong><br>Use a radiator pressure cap, replace the radiator cap with the pressure measurement tool and pump the tester to the recommended value and look for any drops in the pressure value. </p> <p>Another way to do it if do not own a tool similar to the one mentioned above, is to confirm that the car components temperature is low, then with your hands squeeze every radiator tube connection and listen for any suspicious hissing sounds, which can indicate a leak. </p>  "

Let the engine warm up and continue to run throughout the operation unless the vehicle's owner's manual says otherwise. (Be aware that some automatic transmission fluid levels are checked with the engine off. Check the owner's manual.)<p/>  <p>Locate the automatic transmission fluid dipstick, usually near where the transmission or transaxle meets, by the rear of the engine. It looks like the oil dipstick.</p> <p>Observe markings at the end of the dipstick, yours probably has two <strong>full</strong> markings, one for warm conditions and one for cold. If the automatic transmission fluid level falls below the <strong>warm</strong> line, you'll need to top up with automatic transmission fluid. </p> <strong>Grinding Noises:</strong><br> <strong> Jack up the vehicle and safely support it with jack stands. </strong> <p> Grab the wheel and tire assembly at the top and bottom (6 oclock and 12 oclock positions) and shake it back and forth paying attention to noises. If the wheel moves as you shake it, then it means that the hub is bad, and it needs replacement. </p> <p><strong>Visual Inspection:</strong><br> Make sure the vehicle has enough support and remove the wheel assembly. Look for signs of wear and check for friction material coming off of it. </p> <p> Remove the caliper or drum to inspect the brake pads. We're looking for brakes that are worn down to the backing plate or wear indicator. </p> <p><strong>Replace worn clutch disc and pressure plate:</strong> These components are responsible for smoothly engaging gears and wear and tear can cause grinding. <strong> (manual transmission only) </strong></p> <p><strong>Synchronizer ring replacement:</strong> Synchronizers help gears mesh smoothly and worn synchronizers can cause grinding. This usually requires a transmission rebuild, which is a complex and expensive repair. </p></p>"
