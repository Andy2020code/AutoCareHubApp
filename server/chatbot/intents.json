Pay particular attention to hose connections and clamps. </p>   <p><strong>Step 3</strong> Pressure Inspection:</p> <p>WARNING : Turn off the car if on and wait at least a full 2 hours before proceeding with this step. </p> <p><strong>*Optional*</strong><br>Use a radiator pressure cap, replace the radiator cap with the pressure measurement tool and pump the tester to the recommended value and look for any drops in the pressure value. </p> <p>Another way to do it if do not own a tool similar to the one mentioned above, is to confirm that the car components temperature is low, then with your hands squeeze every radiator tube connection and listen for any suspicious hissing sounds, which can indicate a leak. </p>  "
