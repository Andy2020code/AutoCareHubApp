            "context": "The automotive industry is evolving rapidly, with a growing emphasis on sustainability and energy efficiency. One notable advancement is the development of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). PHEVs, similar to HEVs, utilize both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor/battery system. However, what sets PHEVs apart is their ability to be recharged by plugging into an external power source, such as a wall outlet or charging station. This capability allows PHEVs to travel longer distances solely on electric power, reducing reliance on gasoline and further lowering emissions.",
