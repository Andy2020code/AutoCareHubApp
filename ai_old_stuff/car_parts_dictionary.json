It regulates brake pressure to individual wheels, preventing them from locking up during sudden braking. By modulating brake pressure, it ensures optimal traction is maintained, allowing the wheels to continue rolling and enhancing vehicle stability. Additionally, it contributes to the operation of traction and stability control systems, promoting safer driving experiences."
